```
  docker-compose build
```

*   You can register a user but by default it will not have rights even to view list of tasks. Thus you should create a superuser. A superuser can use an admin panel to assign correct groups to other users. Please use the command below:
>
``` 
    winpty docker exec -it cvat bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'
```

*   Choose login and password for your admin account. For more information please read [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser).


*   Open the installed Google Chrome browser and go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080). Type your login/password for the superuser on the login page and press the Login button. Now you should be able to create a new annotation task. Please read the CVAT user's guide for more details.
